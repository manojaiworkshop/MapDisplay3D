# 🎯 Zoom to Cursor - ITERATION 13 FIX

## Critical Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue #1: Invalid JSX Comment Syntax ❌
**Problem:** Nested JSX comments causing Vite errors

**Solution:** Deleted lines 714-718 with invalid nested comments

---

### Issue #2: OrbitControls Not Available 🎯 ROOT CAUSE
**Problem:** `EnhancedZoomToCursor` couldn't access `controls` from `useThree()`

**Solution:** Added `makeDefault` prop to OrbitControls:

```jsx
<OrbitControls
  makeDefault              // ✅ Makes controls accessible
  enableDamping
  ...
/>
```

---

## Testing

Refresh browser and check console:

✅ Should see:
```
🚀 [ZoomToCursor] Component MOUNTED
✅ Event listeners attached
```

Then scroll wheel over map:
```
🔥🔥🔥 WHEEL EVENT RECEIVED!!!
🎯 Zoom IN ✅ applied!
```
