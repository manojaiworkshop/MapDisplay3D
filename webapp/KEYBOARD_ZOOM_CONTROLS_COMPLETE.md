# 🎮 Keyboard & Zoom Controls - Implementation Complete!

## ✅ What's Working Now:

### 1. **Keyboard Camera Movement** ⌨️
- **← Left Arrow**: Move camera LEFT
- **→ Right Arrow**: Move camera RIGHT  
- **↑ Up Arrow**: Move camera FORWARD
- **↓ Down Arrow**: Move camera BACKWARD
- **U key**: Move camera UP (increase altitude)
- **D key**: Move camera DOWN (decrease altitude)

**How it works:**
- Uses `window` keyboard event listeners with `capture: true`
- Prevents default behavior for arrow keys (no page scroll)
- Movement is relative to camera's current orientation
- Updates both camera position AND OrbitControls target
- Speed: 0.5 units/frame (adjustable via `moveSpeed` prop)

### 2. **Zoom to Cursor Position** 🖱️
- **Mouse Wheel**: Zoom in/out while panning toward cursor location
- OrbitControls handles the actual zoom distance
- Custom controller adjusts the target (center point) to cursor position

**How it works:**
- Tracks mouse position in normalized device coordinates (NDC)
- On wheel event, raycasts to find world position under cursor
- Smoothly lerps OrbitControls target toward that position
- Speed: 0.3 lerp factor (adjustable via `zoomSpeed` prop)
- Stops when target is within 0.1 units of cursor position

```
🔥 [ZoomToCursor] WHEEL EVENT - deltaY: -100
🎯 [ZoomToCursor] Target acquired: {
  x: 12.50,
  y: 0.00,
  z: -8.30,
  direction: 'ZOOM IN',
  currentTarget: '(0.00, 0.00)',
  mouseNDC: '(0.45, -0.23)'
}
🎯 [ZoomToCursor] Lerping target: {
  from: '(0.00, 0.00)',
  to: '(3.75, -2.49)',
  goal: '(12.50, -8.30)',
  distance: 9.42
}
✅ [ZoomToCursor] Target reached!
```

## 📁 Files Modified

### 1. **Map3D.jsx**
- Added import: `import { KeyboardCameraController, EnhancedZoomToCursor } from './KeyboardCameraController';`
- Added components in Scene:
  ```jsx
  <KeyboardCameraController moveSpeed={0.5} enabled={true} />
  <EnhancedZoomToCursor enabled={true} zoomSpeed={0.3} />
  ```
- Disabled OrbitControls keyboard: `enableKeys={false}`
- Added keyboard controls help overlay (top-left corner)

### 2. **KeyboardCameraController.jsx** (NEW FILE)
- `KeyboardCameraController` component - handles arrow keys and U/D
- `EnhancedZoomToCursor` component - handles zoom-to-cursor
- Comprehensive debug logging for troubleshooting
- Both exported as named exports

## 🎨 Visual Indicators

**Top-Left Overlay:**
```
⌨️ Keyboard Controls
← → ↑ ↓ Move Camera
U / D Up / Down
🖱️ Scroll to zoom at cursor
```

**Bottom-Right:**
```
📏 Altitude: 8800 km
```

## ⚙️ Configuration Parameters

### KeyboardCameraController
- `moveSpeed`: Movement speed multiplier (default: 0.5)
  - Higher = faster movement
  - Formula: `speed = moveSpeed * delta * 100`
- `enabled`: Enable/disable controller (default: true)

### EnhancedZoomToCursor
- `zoomSpeed`: Lerp factor for target movement (default: 0.3)
  - Range: 0.0 - 1.0
  - Higher = faster pan to cursor
- `enabled`: Enable/disable controller (default: true)

## 🎯 How It Works Together

1. **OrbitControls**: Still handles mouse drag (rotation) and wheel zoom (distance)
2. **KeyboardCameraController**: Moves camera position + updates OrbitControls target
3. **EnhancedZoomToCursor**: Adjusts OrbitControls target during wheel zoom

All three systems work in harmony!

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [x] Arrow keys move camera in correct directions
- [x] U/D keys adjust camera elevation
- [x] Mouse wheel zooms in/out (OrbitControls)
- [x] Zoom pans toward cursor position
- [x] Mouse drag still rotates view
- [x] No page scroll when using arrow keys
- [x] Console shows debug logs
- [x] Help overlay visible in top-left

## 🚀 Performance

- Movement is delta-time adjusted for consistent speed across devices
- Event listeners use `{ passive: true }` for better scroll performance
- Raycasting only happens on wheel events, not every frame
- Lerping stops automatically when target is reached

**Enjoy your new camera controls!** 🎉

**Pro Tips:**
- Hold arrow keys for continuous smooth movement
- Combine keyboard movement with mouse rotation for cinematic shots
- Use U/D keys to get aerial or ground-level views
- Zoom toward specific stations by positioning cursor over them
