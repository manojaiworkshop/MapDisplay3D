# 🎮 Keyboard Camera Controls - Testing Guide

## ✅ Implementation Complete!

### Keyboard Controls Implemented:

1. **Arrow Keys - Camera Movement**
   - `←` Arrow Left: Move camera **LEFT**
   - `→` Arrow Right: Move camera **RIGHT**
   - `↑` Arrow Up: Move camera **FORWARD**
   - `↓` Arrow Down: Move camera **BACKWARD**

2. **Elevation Controls**
   - `U` key: Move camera **UP** (increase altitude)
   - `D` key: Move camera **DOWN** (decrease altitude)

3. **Zoom to Cursor**
   - **Mouse Wheel**: Zoom in/out toward wherever your mouse cursor is pointing
   - The camera will pan to keep the cursor position centered while zooming

### 🧪 How to Test:

1. **Open the app in your browser**: `http://localhost:3000`

2. **Test Arrow Keys**:
   - Press and hold `↑` - You should see the camera move forward
   - Press and hold `←` - You should see the camera move left
   - Press and hold `→` - You should see the camera move right
   - Press and hold `↓` - You should see the camera move backward

3. **Test Elevation**:
   - Press and hold `U` - Camera should rise up
   - Press and hold `D` - Camera should descend

4. **Test Zoom to Cursor**:
   - Move your mouse over different parts of the map
   - Scroll your mouse wheel
   - The camera should zoom toward the cursor position

5. **Check Console Logs**:
   - Open Browser DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Console tab
   - You should see logs like:
     ```
     ✅ [Keyboard] Controller initialized
     ⌨️ [Keyboard] Key pressed: ArrowUp
     🔍 [ZoomToCursor] Zooming to: x: 12.50, z: -8.30
     ```

### 🔧 Changes Made:

**Files Modified:**
1. `Map3D.jsx`
   - Added `KeyboardCameraController` component
   - Added `EnhancedZoomToCursor` component
   - Disabled OrbitControls' default keyboard handling (`enableKeys={false}`)
   - Added keyboard controls help overlay (top-left corner)

2. `KeyboardCameraController.jsx` (NEW FILE)
   - Keyboard event listener for arrow keys, U, D
   - Camera movement logic relative to current view direction
   - OrbitControls target synchronization
   - Zoom-to-cursor functionality with raycasting

### 🎨 Visual Indicators:

**Top Left Corner:**
```
⌨️ Keyboard Controls
← → ↑ ↓ Move Camera
U / D Up / Down
🖱️ Scroll to zoom at cursor
```

**Bottom Right Corner:**
```
📏 Altitude: 8800 km
```

### ⚙️ Technical Details:

- **Movement Speed**: 0.5 units/frame (adjustable via `moveSpeed` prop)
- **Zoom Speed**: 0.15 lerp factor (adjustable via `zoomSpeed` prop)
- **OrbitControls**: Keyboard controls disabled, mouse controls still active
- **Frame Rate**: Movement is delta-time adjusted for consistent speed across devices

### 🐛 Troubleshooting:

**If keys don't work:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Make sure the canvas has focus (click on the 3D view)
3. Verify console shows: `✅ [Keyboard] Controller initialized`

**If zoom doesn't work:**
1. Check console for: `✅ [ZoomToCursor] Controller initialized`
2. Make sure you're moving mouse over the canvas before scrolling
3. Look for: `🔍 [ZoomToCursor] Zooming to: ...` logs

### 🎉 Enjoy Your New Controls!

The keyboard controls work seamlessly with the existing mouse controls:
- **Mouse drag**: Rotate view (OrbitControls)
- **Mouse wheel**: Zoom with OrbitControls + pan to cursor
- **Arrow keys**: Move camera position
- **U/D keys**: Change altitude

**Pro Tip**: Combine keyboard movement with mouse rotation for smooth, cinematic camera control! 🎬
