# Zoom to Cursor Position - Implementation & Testing Guide

## Overview
Fixed the zoom-on-cursor feature in the 3D map. The mouse wheel now zooms the camera toward/away from the exact point on the map where your cursor is hovering.

## What Was Fixed

### Problem
- Mouse wheel zoom was not working
- Camera would not zoom toward cursor position
- Distance constraints were blocking zoom incorrectly

### Solution
1. **Fixed Distance Constraints**: Changed from checking distance to orbit target to checking distance from origin (scene center)
2. **Improved NDC Calculation**: Wheel event now computes mouse position from event coordinates directly
3. **Better Zoom Scaling**: Movement is proportional to distance to cursor intersection point
4. **Proper Event Handling**: Using capture phase on canvas, window, and document to ensure our handler runs before OrbitControls

### Files Modified
- `webapp/frontend/src/components/KeyboardCameraController.jsx`
  - `EnhancedZoomToCursor` component - complete rewrite of `handleWheel` function

## How to Test

### 1. Start the Frontend
```bash
cd /home/manoj/Downloads/sample/webapp/frontend
npm run dev
```

### 2. Open in Browser
- Navigate to http://localhost:3000 (or whatever port Vite shows)
- You should see the 3D map of India with stations

### 3. Test Zoom Behavior
1. **Hover over different map locations** - move your mouse over different parts of India
2. **Scroll the mouse wheel**:
   - Scroll **down** (away from you) â†’ camera zooms **IN** toward cursor position
   - Scroll **up** (toward you) â†’ camera zooms **OUT** away from cursor position
3. **Check the Debug Overlay** (bottom-left corner):
   - Should show logs like "ðŸ”¥ WHEEL EVENT RECEIVED!"
   - Should show "âœ… Ground hit at (x, y, z)"
   - Should show "ðŸŽ¯ Zoom IN âœ…" or "ðŸŽ¯ Zoom OUT âœ…"
   - Should show current camera distance

### 4. Expected Behavior
- âœ… Camera moves toward the point under your cursor when zooming in
- âœ… Camera moves away from the point under your cursor when zooming out
- âœ… Zoom is smooth and proportional to current distance
- âœ… Zoom stops at minimum distance (5 units from origin)
- âœ… Zoom stops at maximum distance (100 units from origin)
- âœ… Works anywhere on the map (over India, ocean, borders)

## Configuration

### Adjust Zoom Sensitivity
In `Map3D.jsx`, you can adjust the `zoomSpeed` prop:

```jsx
<EnhancedZoomToCursor 
  onLog={handleDebugLog} 
  zoomSpeed={0.1}  // Default: 0.1. Lower = slower zoom, Higher = faster zoom
/>
```

### Adjust Distance Limits
In `Map3D.jsx`, configure `OrbitControls`:

```jsx
<OrbitControls
  minDistance={5}    // Minimum zoom-in (closer to origin)
  maxDistance={100}  // Maximum zoom-out (farther from origin)
  // ... other props
/>
```

## Technical Details

### How It Works
1. **Mouse Tracking**: Tracks mouse position in NDC coordinates (-1 to +1 range)
2. **Raycasting**: When wheel event fires, raycast from camera through cursor
3. **Ground Intersection**: Find where ray hits ground plane (y=0)
4. **Calculate Movement**: 
   - Compute vector from camera to intersection point
   - Scale by `zoomSpeed * distance * wheelDelta`
   - Move camera along this vector (toward for zoom in, away for zoom out)
5. **Update Target**: Also move OrbitControls target slightly (30% of camera movement) to maintain view stability
6. **Clamp**: Ensure camera stays within min/max distance from origin

### Distance Calculation
- Uses `camera.position.length()` to get distance from origin (0,0,0)
- Initial camera at [30, 40, 30] â‰ˆ 58.3 units
- Min distance: 5 units (very close)
- Max distance: 100 units (very far)

## Troubleshooting

### "Zoom not working at all"
1. Check browser console / debug overlay for logs
2. Ensure `EnhancedZoomToCursor` is mounted (should see "ðŸš€ [ZoomToCursor] Component MOUNTED")
3. Check that OrbitControls has `enableZoom={false}` in Map3D.jsx
4. Try different areas of the map - some areas may not have ground intersection

### "Zoom blocked immediately"
- Check the console for "Hit minDistance" or "Hit maxDistance" warnings
- Camera might already be at the limit
- Adjust `minDistance` or `maxDistance` in OrbitControls

### "Zoom too fast/slow"
- Adjust `zoomSpeed` prop (default 0.1)
- Lower values (0.05, 0.02) = slower zoom
- Higher values (0.2, 0.5) = faster zoom

### "Zoom feels jerky"
- Current implementation applies movement instantly
- To add smoothing, we can implement lerp-based animation over multiple frames

### "Camera jumps to weird positions"
- May happen if raycast doesn't hit ground
- Check logs for "No ground hit" warnings
- Fallback uses ray projection at 50 units

## Browser Compatibility
- âœ… Chrome/Edge (tested)
- âœ… Firefox (should work)
- âœ… Safari (should work)
- Mouse wheel events work on all modern browsers

## Next Steps / Improvements

### Optional Enhancements
1. **Smooth Animation**: Lerp camera position over several frames instead of instant movement
2. **Zoom Speed Curve**: Non-linear scaling (faster when far, slower when close)
3. **Cursor Icon**: Change cursor to indicate zoom is available
4. **Touch Support**: Add pinch-to-zoom for mobile/tablet
5. **Keyboard Zoom**: Add +/- keys for zoom in/out
6. **Focus Point Indicator**: Show a small dot where zoom will target

### Code Quality
- Add unit tests for raycasting logic
- Add integration tests for camera movement
- Performance profiling (currently very efficient)

## Summary
The zoom-to-cursor feature is now fully functional! You can zoom in/out toward any point on the map by hovering over it and scrolling the mouse wheel. The implementation uses Three.js raycasting to find the 3D point under the cursor and moves the camera intelligently toward/away from that point.
