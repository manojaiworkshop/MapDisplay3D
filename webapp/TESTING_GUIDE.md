## Test Checklist

### âœ… Layout & Scrolling

1. **Chat Panel Scroll**
   - Type many messages in chat
   - Messages area should scroll independently
   - Input box should stay fixed at bottom
   - No horizontal scroll

2. **Map Canvas Height**
   - Map should fill entire right side
   - No vertical scroll on map
   - Map should resize when window resizes
   - Canvas should use full available height

3. **Responsive Design**
   - Desktop: Chat left, Map right (side-by-side)
   - Mobile: Chat top, Map bottom (stacked)
   - Header stays on top
   - Footer stays on bottom

### âœ… Config-Based Actions

1. **Check Available Actions**
   - Open DevTools Console
   - Look for "X actions available" in chat footer
   - Should show "5 actions available"

2. **Test Each Action**

   **Zoom Actions:**
   ```
   zoom to 10x
   zoom in by 2x
   zoom out by 0.5x
   ```
   Expected: Map should zoom accordingly

   **Center Actions:**
   ```
   center 28.64, 77.22
   center on coordinates 19.0760, 72.8777
   ```
   Expected: Map should center on Delhi/Mumbai

   **Pan Actions:**
   ```
   pan to 23.0, 78.0
   ```
   Expected: Map should pan to center of India

   **Go to Station:**
   ```
   goto station Mumbai
   go to New Delhi station
   show me Chennai Central
   ```
   Expected: Map should center on station

   **Reset:**
   ```
   reset view
   reset map
   show full map
   ```
   Expected: Map should reset to India boundary view

3. **Check Action Feedback**
   - After each command, assistant should reply
   - Should show "âœ“ Executed X action(s)"
   - No raw JSON should be visible

### âœ… Backend API

1. **Test Actions Endpoint**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/actions | jq '.actions | keys'
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```json
   [
     "center",
     "goto_station",
     "pan",
     "reset",
     "zoom"
   ]
   ```

2. **Test Interpret Command**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/interpret-command \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"text": "zoom to 15x"}'
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```json
   {
     "actions": [
       {"type": "zoom", "mode": "to", "value": 15}
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Test Multiple Commands**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/interpret-command \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"text": "zoom to 10x and goto station Mumbai"}'
   ```
   Expected: Two actions in response

### âœ… Console Checks

Open Browser DevTools Console and verify:

1. **No Errors**
   - No red error messages
   - No failed network requests

2. **Action Fetching**
   - Should see successful GET request to `/api/actions`
   - Actions object should be populated

3. **Command Processing**
   - Each chat message should trigger POST to `/api/interpret-command`
   - Response should contain actions array

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Chat messages overflow bottom
**Solution**: Check that ChatPanel has `maxHeight: calc(100vh - 320px)` and `overflow-y-auto`

### Issue: Map has vertical scroll
**Solution**: 
- Check parent has `overflow-hidden`
- Check map container has `flex-1 overflow-hidden`

### Issue: "0 actions available"
**Solution**: 
- Check backend is running
- Check `/api/actions` endpoint returns data
- Check browser console for network errors

### Issue: OpenAI errors in backend
**Solution**: OpenAI API v1.0+ is now used. Errors fall back to regex parser automatically.

### Issue: Actions not executing
**Solution**:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `handleAction()` switch statement has case for action type
- Verify mapRef.current is not null

---

## Performance Checks

### Memory
- Chat should not leak memory with many messages
- Map should maintain 60 FPS during pan/zoom

### Responsiveness
- Chat input should be immediately responsive
- Map should update smoothly
- No UI freezing during actions

### Network
- Actions endpoint called once on mount
- Interpret endpoint called once per message
- No unnecessary API calls

---

## Browser Compatibility

Test in:
- âœ… Chrome/Edge (Chromium)
- âœ… Firefox
- âœ… Safari (if available)

All modern browsers should work with Canvas API.

---

## Mobile Testing

If testing on mobile:
1. Chat panel should be on top
2. Map should be below chat
3. Both should use full width
4. Touch interactions should work
5. Scroll should work independently

---

## Success Criteria

âœ… Chat messages scroll independently  
âœ… Map uses full height without scroll  
âœ… All 5 actions work correctly  
âœ… Action count displays (5 actions)  
âœ… No console errors  
âœ… Layout is responsive  
âœ… Config loads from YAML  
âœ… OpenAI v1.0 API works  

If all checks pass: **Implementation successful!** ðŸŽ‰
